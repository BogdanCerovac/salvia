							<p>
								In PDFs clickable links are floting annotations placed above the corresponding links in the text. To meet the accessibility requirements these link annotations need to be connected with the sorresponding LINK tags adding a LINK-OBJR tags to these LINK tags. Missing this connection between the clickable link and the describing link tag might cause some accessibility issues with some PDF readers.<br />
								The program library that's being used to print PDF files, PDFkit, does not yet support this. Therefore, currently all URL addresses have been printed out to the document text.
